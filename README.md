# Helpdesk Ticket Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository documents a comprehensive analysis of helpdesk ticket data aimed at improving support fulfilment strategies. Through meticulous data cleaning and analysis, we've extracted actionable insights that could significantly enhance the efficiency of helpdesk operations.

## Data Description

- `data/raw`: This folder contains the original, uncleaned helpdesk ticket data. It serves as the starting point for the analysis and reflects the data's initial state as received.

- `data/processed`: After a thorough cleaning process, the refined datasets are stored in this folder. These cleaned files are the ones used for the final analysis and contain corrections, formatting, and any other alterations needed to ensure data quality.

Including both datasets supports transparency in the data analysis process and provides a full narrative of the work done.


## Cleaning Process

The data cleaning process is comprehensively documented and includes the following steps:

1. **Data Analysis**: Initial analysis to understand the structure, contents, and quality of the raw data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Based on the analysis, cleaning procedures were performed to:
   - Remove duplicate records.
   - Correct or remove any incorrect data entries.
   - Exclude irrelevant data that does not contribute to the analysis.

## Data Analysis and Summarization

In addition to cleaning the data, extensive analysis and summarization were performed within the Excel environment:

- **Summary**: A concise summary sheet was created to provide a snapshot of the dataset and key metrics.
- **Ticket Viewer**: An interactive ticket viewer was developed for easy access and inspection of individual ticket details.
- **PivotTable_Ticket**: A PivotTable was constructed to dynamically summarize and analyze the ticket data, enabling quick insights into various data segments.
- **PivotChart_Status**: Accompanying the PivotTable, a PivotChart was designed to visually represent the status distribution of the tickets, offering an intuitive understanding of the data's status composition.

## Tools Used
- **Excel**: For preliminary data assessments.
- **PowerPoint**: For the creation of the presentation that conveys our findings.
