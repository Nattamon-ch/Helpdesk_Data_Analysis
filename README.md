# Helpdesk Ticket Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository documents a comprehensive analysis of helpdesk ticket data aimed at improving support fulfilment strategies. Through meticulous data cleaning and analysis, we've extracted actionable insights that could significantly enhance the efficiency of helpdesk operations.

## Data Description

- `data/raw`: This folder contains the original, uncleaned helpdesk ticket data. It serves as the starting point for the analysis and reflects the data's initial state as received.

- `data/processed`: After a thorough cleaning process, the refined datasets are stored in this folder. These cleaned files are the ones used for the final analysis and contain corrections, formatting, and any other alterations needed to ensure data quality.

Including both datasets supports transparency in the data analysis process and provides a full narrative of the work done.


## Cleaning Process

The data cleaning process is comprehensively documented and includes the following steps:

1. **Data Analysis**: Initial analysis to understand the structure, contents, and quality of the raw data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Based on the analysis, cleaning procedures were performed to:
   - Remove duplicate records.
   - Correct or remove any incorrect data entries.
   - Exclude irrelevant data that does not contribute to the analysis.

## Tools Used
- **Excel**: For preliminary data assessments.
- **PowerPoint**: For the creation of the presentation that conveys our findings.


## Findings
