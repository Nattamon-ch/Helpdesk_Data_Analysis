# Helpdesk Ticket Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository documents a comprehensive analysis of helpdesk ticket data, aimed at improving support fulfillment strategies. Through meticulous data cleaning and analysis, we've extracted actionable insights that could significantly enhance the efficiency of helpdesk operations.

## Data Description

- `data/raw`: This folder contains the original, uncleaned helpdesk ticket data. It serves as the starting point for the analysis and reflects the data's initial state as received.

- `data/processed`: After a thorough cleaning process, the refined datasets are stored in this folder. These cleaned files are the ones used for the final analysis and contain corrections, formatting, and any other alterations needed to ensure data quality.

Including both datasets supports transparency in the data analysis process and provides a full narrative of the work done.


## Cleaning Process
Data integrity is paramount. In the `docs` directory, you'll find a thorough chronicle of the data cleaning process, addressing missing values, anomalies, and data normalization to ensure high-quality analysis.


## Tools Used
- **Excel**: For preliminary data assessments.
- **PowerPoint**: For the creation of the presentation that conveys our findings.


## Findings
For an overview of the insights derived from our data analysis, refer to the `presentation` directory. It contains the PowerPoint slides that encapsulate the core findings and recommendations from this project.
